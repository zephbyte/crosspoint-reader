# Changelog

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added Back/Cancel support while downloading books from OPDS catalogs.
- Added a Recent Books long-press menu in both List and Grid views with delete, cache delete, completion, and remove-from-recents actions.
- Added a Minimal sleep screen option that shows the current book cover and reading progress on a dark background.
- Added more detailed WiFi connection debug logs for scans, selected networks, status changes, disconnect reasons, and timeouts.
- Added a 9pt `Itty Bitty` reader font size, plus build flags for omitting Itty Bitty and Large reader font assets in size-constrained firmware variants.
- Added an in-reader confirmation message when a shortcut turns tilt-to-turn on or off.

### Fixed
- Fixed WiFi and OPDS connection-flow edge cases so manual Settings connections show the connected status first, copied or corrupted saved-password files are rejected before use, OPDS retries show loading before requests, and large OPDS feeds fail safely under low memory instead of rebooting.
- Fixed reader and Home UI polish issues, including landscape status-bar settings, missing Vietnamese labels, File Browser and Lyra Carousel icon alignment, cover thumbnail artifacts, and duplicate Home progress/stat loading.
- Fixed EPUB cache and low-memory handling by using stable cache folder keys, migrating older cache folders where possible, rebuilding stale section caches, laying out very long text blocks earlier, streaming table fallback content when heap is tight, and clarifying the warning text.
- Fixed sleep-entry, network, and SD-card font download reliability issues by reusing cached sleep-screen assets, idling OPDS pages normally after load, putting the X3 tilt sensor back to sleep outside the reader, disabling WiFi power saving during transfers, reducing WebDAV stack usage, tolerating longer stalls, retrying interrupted font files, and freeing active reader fonts when needed.
- Fixed remaining reader service edge cases, including an XTC chapter selector crash on memory-constrained builds, SD-card font size selection, SD-card font-size shortcuts skipping manually installed sizes, and KOReader Sync login compatibility with self-hosted servers that return valid JSON on success.

### Changed
- Modified upstream "page-as-sleep" behavior into a new `Sleep Screen > Quick Resume` option, which also keeps `Quick Resume on Timeout` on, and renamed the timeout-only toggle.
- Improved reader and browser menu behavior by moving the Footnotes shortcut above Select Chapter, wrapping long book titles in action menus, and reducing progress-screen repaint work during OPDS and SD font downloads.

## [v1.2.11.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed
- Removed Medium font size from `xlarge` build to get it below the size limit

### Fixed
- Included Lyra Carousel by activating the build flag `DCROSSINK_ENABLE_LYRA_CAROUSEL=1`

## [v1.2.11] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- Added new personal theme: "Minimal"
- Added a custom sleep timer picker so `Time to Sleep` can be set from 1 to 30 minutes instead of cycling fixed presets.
- Added an in-reader Controls shortcut so you can customize your buttons without leaving the book.
- Added bookmark cleanup shortcuts: hold Select on a bookmark to delete it, or hold Open on a book in Bookmarks to clear that book's bookmark list.
- Added a confirmation message after deleting a book's cache from the reader or File Browser.
- Added a File Browser long-press action for deleting an EPUB or XTC book's cache
- Added a downloaded-font size range setting so SD-card fonts can use compact, default, or large point-size sets.
- Added a File Browser long-press action for marking EPUB books as finished or unfinished.

### Changed
- Hardened deep sleep entry by shutting WiFi down before waiting for the power button to be released.
- Raised the web file-transfer filename limit from 100 to 150 bytes so longer uploaded filenames are preserved.
- Made the in-reader Reader Options menu include the same Reader settings and actions as Settings > Reader.
- Split SD-card font descriptions and supported languages into separate lines in the font download screen.

### Fixed
- Fixed inline EPUB images disappearing in landscape when their bottom edge slightly overlaps the screen margin.
- Reduced unnecessary low-memory image suppression for JPEG-heavy EPUB chapters and added CSS heap diagnostics during chapter rebuilds.
- Allowed wider inline JPEG images in EPUBs to render when they still fit the total pixel and heap safety limits.
- Fixed the SD-card font picker reopening immediately after selecting a font from Settings > Reader > Font Family.
- Fixed in-reader font-size changes for SD card fonts not working
- Fixed in-reader SD-card font changes not always rebuilding the current EPUB page layout.

## [v1.2.10] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- Added a `Recent Books View` setting so the dedicated Recent Books screen can switch between the classic list and a 3x3 cover grid.
- Added more flexible reader controls, including orientation-aware front/side button settings, nav-only or all-button front inversion, tilt page turn shortcuts, and side-button long-press rotation actions.
- Added a per-session auto page turn interval picker with values from 5 to 120 seconds.
- Added a file-browser Home/Back long-press action for toggling hidden files and folders.
- Added EPUB rendering and diagnostics improvements, including visible `<hr>` separators and heap logs around section rebuilds, image extraction, page serialization, and sleep-cache rebuilds.
- Added reader font coverage for block redactions, black-square ornaments, Greek category letters, and turned-comma punctuation (PR #104).
- Added simulator tools for testing sleep/wake behavior and smoke-testing common screens and EPUB reader menus.

### Changed
- Reduced Controls settings section spacing so the grouped controls fit better on X3 screens.
- Made front reader long-press actions trigger when the hold delay is reached while normal page turns still trigger on release.
- Used the fast EPUB spine/TOC indexing path for books with 300+ spine entries so heavily split books build `book.bin` faster on first open.
- Allowed the web file manager and WebDAV to browse dot-prefixed hidden files when hidden files are enabled, matching the device file browser.

### Fixed
- Fixed reader button and shortcut behavior, including X3 power-button wake filtering, folder delete long-press timing, and WiFi scan/connect screens that could not be exited while work was in progress.
- Fixed RoundedRaff home-menu, keyboard, and button-hint rendering issues so Settings remains reachable and compact labels no longer overlap or disappear.
- Fixed font and glyph handling by reducing persistent SD-card font advance-cache memory, releasing optional font caches before image extraction only when heap is tight, and showing a visible replacement symbol when compact UI fonts lack `U+FFFD`.
- Fixed KOReader Sync authentication diagnostics and an in-reader sync crash, including clearer handling when a server or proxy returns non-JSON content.
- Fixed EPUB text rendering for redactions, whitespace-only XHTML text nodes, simple black CSS span backgrounds, list bullets in `<li><p>...</p></li>` items, and very long base64-like text runs.
- Fixed EPUB image, thumbnail, and section-rebuild stability so image-heavy chapters use less temporary memory, scale images more reliably, avoid stale dimensions, and suppress optional image work earlier under heap pressure.
- Fixed EPUB low-memory and cache safety by skipping optional next-chapter indexing and sleep-page cache rebuilds when heap is tight, failing safely with a malformed-book warning and Home exit path, rebuilding incompatible fork-written caches, and handling low-memory CSS parsing, truncated SD writes, invalid serialized strings, and failed temp-cache promotion.
- Fixed a Home crash after clearing reading cache by skipping optional EPUB thumbnail rebuilds when the source EPUB cache is missing.
- Fixed reader prewarm behavior by skipping image decoding, keeping mixed-style font glyphs cached together, and avoiding section rebuilds for render-quality-only option changes.
- Fixed concurrent render/storage crashes by serializing `GfxRenderer` scratch-buffer access, shared SPI bus access, and failed SPI lock cleanup.
- Fixed Recent Books, EPUB/XTC thumbnail caches, deleted-folder metadata, and XTC cover scaling so cached book data stays in sync and grid covers fill their slots correctly.
- Fixed simulator build configuration so SDL2 and simulator-provided network/OTA shims compile cleanly.

## [v1.2.9.1] - 2026-05-03

### Changed
- Cleaned up EPUB table rendering by removing synthetic row/cell labels and defaulting table cells to readable left alignment
- Allow simple EPUB tables with full-width note rows so a single `colspan` cell spanning the whole table no longer forces the entire table back to paragraph fallback

### Fixed
- Fix power-button shortcut conflicts outside the reader so reader-only actions fall back to `Confirm` while Sleep, Refresh, Screenshot, Sync Progress, and File Transfer remain real power actions. Those that had short-press power button to act as sleep saw unstable behavior previously. This should be fixed now
- Fix a potential crash when using `Go to %` in EPUBs
- Fix a potential crash when entering sleep with Page Overlay enabled if the cached EPUB page data is invalid
